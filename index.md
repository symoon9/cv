## About Me

I am an undergraduate student at Seoul National University (SNU), studying Computer Science and Engineering as well as Cognitive Neural Computation (a major desigend by my self).    
I would love to study neural mechanisms in the brain using computational tools.

## Research Interests

- **Computational Neuroscience:** brain modeling, neural decoding, SNN, RNN
- **Systems Neuroscience:** reading skills, sensory perception

## News
- **[Oct. 2023]** I wrote an abstract titled, **"Towards scalable embedding models for spatial transcriptomics data"**, and submitted to [MLCB](https://mlcb.github.io/)
- **[Mar. 2023]** I started to work as an undergraduate researcher at AIMS Lab at UW!
- **[Mar. 2023]** I went to UW as a exchange student!
