## About Me

I am a senior undergraduate student at Seoul National University, studying **Computer Science & Engineering**, as well as **Cognitive Neural Computation** (a major designed on my own).    
My ultimate goal is to study neural mechanisms in the brain using computational tools, and eventually, simulate the whole brain in silico.

## Research Interests
I am interested in **Biological and Artificial Intelligence**.
Specifically, **Brain Modeling / Neural Decoding / Representation Learning / Neuro AI**

## News
- **[Dec. 2023]** My co-first author paper **"Early Life Stress Modulates the Genetic Influence on Brain Structure and Cognitive Function in Children"** is accepted by Heliyon
- **[Nov. 2023]** My first author paper **"Towards scalable embedding models for spatial transcriptomics data"** is accepted for poster presentation at [MLCB](https://mlcb.github.io/) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_M-BRcflc) is the video for the virtual presentation
- **[Mar. 2023]** I started to work as an undergraduate researcher at [AIMS Lab](https://suinlee.cs.washington.edu/home) at UW!
