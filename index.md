## About Me
HiðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a first-year PhD student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) in the [Computational Biology Department](https://cbd.cmu.edu/). I havenâ€™t decided which lab to join, but Iâ€™m interested in general neuroscience projects. Before CMU, I completed my bachelorâ€™s at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/), majoring in Computer Science & Engineering and Cognitive Neural Computation.

## Research Interests
I am interested in **Biological and Artificial Intelligence**.
Specifically, **Brain Modeling / Neural Decoding / Representation Learning / Neuro AI**

## News
- **[Aug. 2024]** I officially graduated from SNU!
- **[Aug. 2024]** I started my PhD at CMU!
- **[Dec. 2023]** My co-first author paper **"Early Life Stress Modulates the Genetic Influence on Brain Structure and Cognitive Function in Children"** is accepted by Heliyon
- **[Nov. 2023]** My first author paper **"Towards scalable embedding models for spatial transcriptomics data"** is accepted for poster presentation at [MLCB](https://mlcb.github.io/) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_M-BRcflc) is the video for the virtual presentation
