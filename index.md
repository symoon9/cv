## About Me
Hi there 👋      
I’m a first-year PhD student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) in the [Computational Biology Department](https://cbd.cmu.edu/) advised by [Jose Lugo-Martinez](https://cbd.cmu.edu/people/lugo-martinez.html). Before CMU, I completed my bachelor’s at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/), majoring in Computer Science & Engineering and Cognitive Neural Computation.

## Research Interests
scRNA-seq, Spatial Transcriptomics, Aging \\
I'm also interested in computational neuroscience (Brain Modeling / Neural Decoding / Representation Learning / Neuro AI)

## News
- **[Feb. 2025]** I joined Lugo-Martinez Lab
- **[Aug. 2024]** I started my PhD at CMU!
- **[Dec. 2023]** My co-first author paper **"Early Life Stress Modulates the Genetic Influence on Brain Structure and Cognitive Function in Children"** is published at Heliyon
- **[Nov. 2023]** My first author paper **"Towards scalable embedding models for spatial transcriptomics data"** is accepted for poster presentation at [MLCB](https://mlcb.github.io/) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_M-BRcflc) is the video for the virtual presentation
